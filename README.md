# Umbraco Fluidity - Contributor License Agreement

The purpose of this repository is to seek retrospective signing of a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for past contributors to the [Fluidity](https://github.com/mattbrailsford/umbraco-fluidity) project. For Umbraco v8, in order to make the Fluidity project maintainable we are looking to move to a commercial + "source available" licensing approach where use of the product will require a paid for license, but we will look to keep the vast majority of the source code available so that developers can still contribute or build custom solutions where required.

Due to this change however, it will mean a change in license from Apache 2.0 to a "source available" licensing strategy (exact license is TBC but we are currently reviewing the [PolyForm Perimeter license](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/perimeter/1.0.0/)). As past contributors though, the copyright of those contributions has only been licensed to the Fluidity project under the same Apache 2.0 license and so approval to grant Matt Brailsford & Outfield Digital Ltd an unrestricted copyright license is required to be able to make this licensing change.

**Important:** Please note that this license change is only in relation to the v8+ port of Fluidity. The existing v7 Fluidity version will remain under the Apache 2.0 license.

## How to sign

This page contains a list of people who have made source code contributions to the Fluidity project where that contribution is still present in the v8 codebase. To sign the agreement, we request developers make a change to this [README](README.md) file, checking off their name from the list below by adding an `x` between the square brackets by their name and submitting this change as a PR. During the PR process we will use [cla-assistant.io](https://cla-assistant.io/) to capture your approval of the CLA.
